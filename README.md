### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. DOM has four aspects: indentification, or how to get a reference to a specific node; traversal, or how to move around the DOM tree; node manipulation, or how to access or confirm DOM nodes; and tree manipulation, or how the structure of a tree can be altered.
2. Document elements, content, properties, and attributes can be accessed in multiple ways. Elements can be accessed by id value, tag name, class name, name, and CSS selectors. Its content can be accessed by using textContent; its CSS properties through DOM. Its element attributes can be accessed using a period and the name of
attribute after element reference Can use to look up attribute value and assign to
the variable. It can also be used to assign a new value to the attribute.
3. A node is an element of HTML, which is represented by a DOM tree structure. Every HTML element is considered a node, so a DOM tree represents nodes. Nodes are set into action by other thngs, such as a document and element.
